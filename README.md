# Hello!

## About Me
My name's Esperanza Rozas and I'm a fourth year Data Science student at UC San Diego. I'm experienced with Python and data analytics/some visualization packages for Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), with additional experience in R, Java, PostgreSQL, and d3.js.

## Repositories
This page mostly has private repositories for class assignments, but there are two repositories of projects I've worked/am working on in my pinned that you can take a look at:

1. Capstone-Brick-Modeling is a repository detailing my senior capstone project for Data Science, completed in a team of 4 from January - mid-March 2023 (planned). It involves taking data from HVAC systems in UC San Diego's Computer Science building, making a decision tree model to predict energy values, and using that model to determine which combination of factors will be most important to optimize cost. My main contributions were to the scripting-based element of the code and report/poster.
2. soccerDemo is a repository from a project I worked on from January - May 2022 through the Data Science Student Society, where a team of four of us analyzed soccer data from [StatsBomb's open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) and how passing succeeds in a team. My main work on this project was data cleaning and interactive data visualization for the demo. If you'd like a video of the demo because the cloud version isn't working, please email me at erozas@ucsd.edu.
