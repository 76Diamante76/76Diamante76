# Hello!

## About Me
My name's Esperanza Rozas and I'm a Data Science graduate from UC San Diego.

## Repositories
This page mostly has private repositories for former class assignments, but there are two repositories of projects I have worked on in my pins that you can take a look at:

1. Capstone-Brick-Modeling is a repository detailing my senior capstone project for Data Science, completed in a team of 4 from January - March 2023. It involves taking data from HVAC systems in UC San Diego's Computer Science building, making a decision tree model to predict energy values, and using that model to determine which combination of factors will be most important to optimize cost. My main contributions were to the scripting-based element of the code and exploration work into the BrickSchema system.

2. soccerDemo is a repository from a project I worked on from January - May 2022 through the Data Science Student Society at UC San Diego, where a team of four of us analyzed soccer data from [StatsBomb's open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) and how passing succeeds in a team. My main work on this project was data cleaning and interactive data visualization for the demo. If you'd like a video of the demo because the cloud version isn't working, please email me at erozas@ucsd.edu.
